### API Changes
- Graph API
  - Add `getEdges(int type)` to `Graph` to allow retrieval of only edges of a specific type.
  - Add `getEdgeTypeLabels(boolean)` to `GraphModel`.
  - Add min/max to `TimeSet` and `Element.getTimeBounds()`.
  - Add `Column.exists()` as new utility.
  - Add `GraphLock` to the API in `Graph` to expose locking states.
  - Make `Table` a `Collection` of `Column`.
  - Add new method `Column.isDynamicAttribute()`.
  - Add `toSet()` in addition of `toCollection()` to element iterables.
  - Add new `Table.countColumns(Origin)` method.
  - Add `getElementIndex()` methods to `GraphModel` when providing a `Table`.
  - Add `isNodeTable()` and `isEdgeTable()` methods to `Table`.
- Appearance API (under development)
  - `Partition` and `Ranking` now always receive the `Graph` as parameter for all methods that do need access to the underlying index to facilitate local scale support.
  - Add `getColumn()` to `Ranking` so it aligns with `Partition`.
  - Add `getNormalizedValue()` to `Ranking` to more easily retrieve the normalised value.
  - `Partition` now has a static `DEFAULT_COLOR` when the color is not found for a given value.
  - Removed `Partition.setColors()` as it was prone to confusion.
  - Add `transformAll(Iterable<? extends Element>)` to `Function`.
  - Split `isLocalScale()` into `isRankingLocalScale()` and `isPartitionLocalScale()` in `AppearanceModel`.
  - Make `Function` getters in `AppearanceModel` independent from `Graph` as this should be handled automatically based on the local/global state.
- Preview API
  - A `postProcess()` method has been added to the `Renderer` SPI to allow customization once all items have been rendered.

### API Changes
- A new **optional** `FileAware` interface in `FileImporter` in `ImporterAPI`. This allows file importers to receive the file to import in a `setFile` method instead of the `setReader` method being called. If your `FileImporter` implements this interface, `setFile` will be called, and `setReader` will not be called.

### API Changes

- The functionalities of `DynamicAPI` have either been replaced by native `GraphAPI` support or added to the `TimelineAPI`, effectively removing `DynamicAPI` from the codebase. The `TimeFormat` can be set via `setTimeFormat()` on `GraphModel`. Estimators are now configurable per column and can directly be set from the `Column`. Obtaining the minimum time bounds can now be obtained from the `TimeIndex` directly from `GraphModel`.
- The `createQuery()` method in `FilterController` now takes a `FilterBuilder` instead of a `Filter`. It allows to track down builders down to the query level.
- The `ImportAPI` now supports importing multiple graphs at the time and supports graph slices through an additional parameter on `ContainerLoader`. The `setTimestamp()` and `setInterval()` allows to define a point or period of existence for the entire graph. The `ImportController` also allow multiple containers to be processed through a new `process()` method. In parallel, `ImporterUI` now takes multiple importers and so does the `Processor` interface that now takes multiple containers.
- The `NodeFilter` and `EdgeFilter` interfaces now inherit from a new `ElementFilter` so it's easier to create filters that work at the element level.
- The `filter()` method in `Operator` now takes an array of `Subgraph` instead of `Graph`. This gives access to operations such as `union` or `not`.
- Remove `ClusteringAPI` from codebase. It needs a complete rewrite.
- Add ability to configure timezone with `setTimeZone()` on `ContainerLoader` in `ImportAPI`.
- Remove standalone `ContainerFactory` class in `ImportAPI` and replace it with `Container.Factory`. Also add the ability to configure the `TimeRepresentation` in `ContainerLoader`. Finally, add color parsing utility in `ImportUtils`. It can be used to parse color names or codes.
- The `AttributeModel` parameter in the `execute()` method of `Statistics` interface in `StatisticsAPI` has been removed as all features are now in `GraphModel`.
- The `ChangeListener` in `WorkspaceInformation` has been replaced with a `PropertyChangeListener`.
- Both `RankingAPI` and `PartitionAPI` have been replaced by a new `AppearanceAPI`, which supports both concepts. The SPI allows to create `Transformer` services, which can support either ranking or partition transformations. `Ranking` and `Partition` instances are defined in the API and gives access to underlying data. The core concept in appearance are functions, which wrap the transformation entirely and can be accessed in `AppearanceModel`.
- The _Processing_ dependency in `PreviewAPI` has been removed and replaced by regular Java2D. Therefore, the `ProcessingTarget` is now the `G2DTarget`. Also add a `resize()` method to facilitate integration.
- Addition of a `EdgeWeightMergeStrategy` enum to control the way parallel edge weights are merged in `ImportAPI`.
- Add ability to create `WorkspacePersistenceProvider` with a new SPI interface: `WorkspaceBytesPersistenceProvider`. The XML-based interface has being renamed into `WorkspaceXMLPersistenceProvider`.
- Importers can now use the `setValueString()` method on `ElementDraft`. This will automatically parse the value based on the declared type reducing parsing code on the importer side. If the type is already in the right type, use the `setValue()` instead.
- Refactoring of the import API. Introduction of a `ColumnDraft` interface which represents a to-be-created column and the method to manipulate them in `ContainerLoader`. The `NodeDraft` and `EdgeDraft` classes now inherits from a new `ElementDraft`, centralizing a lot of the code. The `EdgeDraftGetter` and `NodeDraftGetter` have been removed and their methods moved directly to the node/edge draft. New elements are now created using the `ElementDraft.Factory`, which can be obtained with the `factory()` method on `ContainerLoader`. Previously the `ContainerUnloader` returned an `AttributeModel`. This has been replaced with iterables over column drafts. The `EdgeDefault` enum becomes `EdgeDiretionDefault` and represents a graph-level configuration. The `EdgeDefault` is now edge-level configuration and can be set by `setEdgeDirection()` on `EdgeDraft`. Finally, convenient `setColor()` methods have been added to `ElementDraft`.
- Complete rewrite of the `GraphAPI` and add [GraphStore](http://github.com/gephi/graphstore) as dependency. The new API is entirely defined in the GraphStore project and Gephi makes it available through the `GraphAPI`. The `AttributesAPI` functionalities have been consolidated into the new graph API and therefore has been removed. There is too many API changes to be listed all but notable ones are the following.
    - All attribute features (e.g. add column) are now directly accessible from the `GraphModel`, and there's no more `AttributeModel`.
    - The `AttributeColumn` is renamed into `Column`, the `AttributeTable` is renamed into `Table`, `AttributeOrigin` is renamed into `Origin` and the `AttributeType` has been replaced by the direct usage of `Class` objects. Moreover, the `AttributeUtils` is now entirely static (i.e. no more needed to obtain an instance) and has multiple important additions such as full parse support.
    - The support for hierarchical graphs has been removed, but multi-graph support added. Each edge now can have a relationship type, and is zero by default. These types can be associated with an arbitrary label object, which can be configured in `GraphModel.addEdgeType()`.
    - All node/edge data are now directly accessible from the interface. For instance, attribute values can be retrieved with the `getAttribute()` methods. All properties such as color or position are also accessible directly on the Node/Edge interfaces.
    - Dynamic graphs can now be represented with timestamps as well. Intervals are still supported but the API user must configure the preferred representation through the `Configuration` (must be done at initialization). The way elements' existence overtime has been greatly simplified with the addition of timestamp/interval management methods on `Element`, which both `Node` and `Edge` extends. See for instance `addTimestamp()`, `addInterval()`, `getTimestamps()` or `getIntervals()`. Similarly, each attribute getter or setter in `Element` is available with timestamps and intervals parameters so attribute values over time can be configured. Behind the scenes, the dynamic types used are defined in `org.gephi.graph.api.types`.
    - There's a new `Subgraph` interface that extends `Graph` and is available from `GraphModel.getGraph(GraphView)`. This subgraph interface has additional features such as `union()` or `intersection()`.
    - The graph listening system with `GraphListener` has been entirely replaced with a pull-based system of observers. The system no longer sends events at each update but listeners can create observers, which periodically check if something has changed. There's multiple types of observers: `GraphObserver` for topology changes, `TableObserver` for new/removed columns and `ColumnObserver` for attribute value changes. These observers can obtain diff objects such as `GraphDiff` or `TableDiff` to exactly obtain what has changed.

### API Changes

- Add a needsItemBuilder method to Renderer in Preview API. This helps to avoid building unnecessary items while refreshing preview.
- Preview API changes: Added a getDisplayName to Renderer and support for extending default preview renderers. Added a renderer manager to preview controlled with new methods in PreviewModel and PreviewController.
- Add a local scale flag in Ranking API. The value can be set from theRankingController.
- Add RangeFilter interface in Filters API to help create range filters. The filter system now automatically manages the range values and bounds. The Range object now also supports exclusive intervals.
- Add a new AttributableFilter filter type. This is useful for filters manipulating Attributable objects regardless whether they belong to a node or edge. Also note new useful abstract plugin implementations have been added to the FiltersPlugin module. Use AbstractFilter for any filter and AbstractAttributeFilter for filters based on attributes. Filter builders are also provided.
- Update to Netbeans Platform 7.1 and it's new perspective system. The PerspectiveMember SPI has to go away and will break compatibility. Top components now directly declare the perspective they belong to in the @TopComponent.Registration annotation, for instance roles = {"overview"} for the Overview perspective.
- Add a REPLACE_COLUMN event type in AttributeEvent.
- New Timeline API exposed as a stable API. Th API controls the Timeline UI component and the animation framework.
- Add a new TIME_FORMAT event in DynamicModelEvent. The event is triggered when the time format is initialized.
- Add a getGraphTable() in the AttributeModel. The GraphView elements can also have attributes using the same system as nodes and egdes. The data can be accessed through the Graph.getAttributes() method.

### API Changes

- Complete rewrite of the Preview API with a new SPI which allows to extend the Preview with new renderers, item builders or render targets. The API also now offers better customization through a central property system and is optimized for external applications as well. The API is also now considered as stable.
- New DynamicStatistics SPI in the StatisticsAPI module. The interface extends Statistics and implement the calculation of metrics over time.
- Important changes in graph events breaking API compatibility. The ADD_NODES and ADD_EDGES are merged into a ADD_NODES_AND_EDGES event. Similarly REMOVE_NODES and REMOVE_EDGES are merged into a REMOVE_NODES_AND_EDGES event. - GraphEventData remains the same and still contains both added/removed nodes and edges. Users may simply test if arrays returned by addedNodes(), addedEdges(), removedNodes() and removedEdges() are null before using them.
- Add new executeLayout(numIterations) method in LayoutController.
- The StatisticsController now supports synchronous algorithm execution through the execute(Statistics) method.
- Add new startAutoTransform() and stopAutoTransform() in Ranking API to control auto transformations. The model also allows to retrieve the ranking used in the auto transformation. An additional refreshRanking() method has been added in the RankingBuilder SPI for a smoother auto transformation support.
- Added a new AttributeRowsMergeStrategy interface to Data Laboratory API. This is a type of manipulator that defines and strategy for merging values of a row (node or edge) for an specific column. It should be used by other manipulators such as NodesManipulator MergeNodes
- Complete refactoring of the Ranking API to improve modularity and reach a stable version of the API. The API now also has a SPI for ranking builders and transformers. Instead of getNodeRanking() and getEdgeRanking in the model, we introduce the concept of element type and generalize methods to it. Use Ranking.NODE_ELEMENT to obtain a node ranking and Ranking.EDGE_ELEMENT for an edge ranking. Same idea for transformers, which are now defined by a unique name. Default transformers' name can be found in the Transformer interface. A RankingEvent has also been created. API users have to update to their client code to be compatible.
- Add a new interface nodes and edges share: Attributable. That allows to manipulate objects with attributes regardless if the object is a node or an edge. Node, Edge, NodeData and EdgeData now implements this interface, and a getAttributes() method has been added to Node and Edge to make development easier.

### API Changes

- Add setCurrentQuery() method on FilterController
- Important change how modules save/load data into project files. The WorkspacePersistenceProvider interface from - ProjectAPI now uses StAX instead of DOM. The writeXML() method now uses XMLStreamWriter and readXML() XMLStreamReader. Backward compatibility can't be assured, modules have to use switch to StAX.
- Added support of shortcut keys, availability of items and sub-items creation to Data Laboratory context menu actions (NodesManipulator and EdgesManipulator). Also now Visualization API has an SPI for adding context menu actions (GraphContextMenuItem) to nodes like DataLaboratory does with NodesManipulator. Note that they share the interface ContextMenuItemManipulator from Data Laboratory API, so they are compatible, being able to reuse actions on nodes for Overview and Data Laboratory.
- Add removeMetaEdge(Edge) to manually remove meta edges. Add getTotalEdgeCount() method to globally count the number of edges, regardless if the edge is proper or meta.
- Add methods in Graph API to better combine edges and meta edges features. Add getEdgesAndMetaEdges(Node) and getTotalDegree(Node) methods, as well as their in and out variants for HierarchicalDirectedGraph.

- Add 'destroy(Filter filter)' in 'FilterBuilder' to receive notification when a filter query is removed and clean-up.
- Add 'MetaEdgeBuilder' in Graph SPI to allow custom builders. Add 'GraphSettings.setMetaEdgeBuilder()' in the graph model settings.
- Modify 'StatisticsModel' to store reports directly instead of 'Statistics' instance. As a consequence, the model has now a 'getReport()' and a 'getResult()' method that UI can use. The currently running statistics can now be get with a new 'getRunning()' method.
- Simplify and improve attribute events management. Event listeners now subscribe directly from the 'AttributeModel' instead of 'AttributeTable' and will receive events for all tables. Refactoring of the 'AttributeEvent' class with 'AttributeTable' as source and a new 'AttributeEventData' object as data. A new 'SET_VALUE' has been implemented for getting events when attribute values are set.
- Changes in 'AttributeRowFactory', the 'newNodeRow()' method now takes the owner object 'NodeData' as a parameter. Similarly for 'newEdgeRow()' and 'newRowForTable()'.
- Add 'getEdge(Node, Node)' in GraphAPI for consistency reasons.
- Changes in Processor SPI. The 'Processor' has now setters instead of a 'process()' method with parameters. How processors are created remains the same. Creation of a 'ProcessorUI' interface for processors settings configuration. A 'ProcessorUI' implementation provides a panel, which is shown when the import report is closing. The 'ProcessorUI' also allows to disable a processor with some conditions.
- Add 'getColor()' method in 'NodeDraft' and 'EdgeDraft'.
- Define the "Overview, "Data Laboratory" and "Preview" as perspectives. Create a new SPI for perspecives and perspective members. Members are simply the 'TopComponent' that belong to a perspective. Plugins can implement 'PerspectiveMember' to define the open and close behaviour.
- Add list/array types in Attributes API. All native types has now a related list type, except dynamic types. The list types inherits from 'AbstractList'.
- Changes in the way Import API deals with time intervals and dynamic data. Support for dynamic attributes has been added with a new 'addAttributeValue()' method in 'NodeDraft' and 'EdgeDraft'. For improving data cleanup possibilities, 'NodeDraftGetter' and 'EdgeDraftgetter' now returns an 'AttributeRow' instead of a list of attribute values only. Finally to profit from latest improvements, draft elements returns directly a 'TimeInterval' type instead of the list of slices. Methods with 'Slice' have been renamed to 'Interval' for consistency reasons.
- Add dynamic types into Attributes API. Dynamic types store values with a time interval and query can be customized with estimators. All dynamic types inherit from 'DynamicType'
- Graph API event management improvements. The 'GraphEvent' has now precise events, including 'ADD_NODES', 'REMOVE_NODES', 'ADD_EDGES', 'REMOVE_EDGES' and 'VISIBLE_VIEW'. A new 'GraphEventData' interface has been created to retrieve elements related to the events.
- Export API refactoring, inspired from ImportAPI. Create an 'ExporterBuilder' interface for exporter creation and different exporters: 'GraphExporter', 'VectorExporter', 'ByteExporter' and 'CharacterExporter' that covers common cases. The way exporters write data has been rationalized by using either 'java.io.Writer' (text) or 'java.io.OutputStream' (byte). The 'ExportController' has been improved to support all use-cases, including file, writer and stream export.
- Add Spigot support to the ImportAPI and SPI. Like 'DatabaseImporter', the 'SpigotImporter' interface is a new type of Importers. Modifications have also be made to the 'ImportController' to support spigot import.
- Refactoring and improvements in the Import API and SPI. The refactoring aim is to solve the singleton issue with importers and let users implement builders interface that create importers instance. Therefore an 'ImporterBuilder' interface has been created and should be registered with the '@ServiceProvider' annotation. The various importers types have been simplified and leave more choice to the implementations about how the input is managed. XML and Text file importers has been merged in a 'FileImporter' interface, working with the 'java.io.Reader'. Utility static methods, for instance <em>get Document from Reader</em> can now be found in a new 'ImportUtils' class. The 'ImportController' has been simplified for File import and now accepts 'java.io.Reader' also. The main improvement on these modules in the support of UI components for importers. The aim is to let importers define an 'ImporterUI' implementation to manage settings of these importers.
- Improvements in the GraphAPI identifiers management. The system is now storing String identifiers coming from users. New getters and setters methods have been created in 'Graph': 'Graph.setId(Node, String)', 'Graph.setId(Edge, String)', 'Graph.getNode(String)', 'Graph.getEdge(String)'. The 'NodeData.setId()' and 'EdgeData.setId()' methods have been removed, compatibility can't be kept. Factory has also be changed to allow to create elements with String ID directly, as it's not possible anymore to do it from 'NodeData'.
- Changes in AttributesAPI with event management. The lookup system in 'AttributeTable' has been replaced by a more traditional event management system, with new 'AttributeEvent' and 'AttributeListener' interfaces. The dispatch implementation is also now on a separate thread.
- Changes in Import modules to separate core and user interfaces. The 'ImportController' is now doing import task only and a new 'ImportControllerUI' is displaying the user interface (Report Panel). The 'ImportControllerUI' interface is located in the DesktopProject module and should be user to properly import file from Plugins. The 'ImportController' methods could be used from the toolkit.
